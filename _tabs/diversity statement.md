This is a summary of my diversity statement:

As a member of the LGBTQ+ community who grew up in a monocultural and monoethnic society that socially persecutes marginalized people, I strive for inclusivity and diverse representations in society and at work. At NHN diquest, I pushed for the use of more inclusive language and the removal of discriminatory or offensive terms from code, documentation, and data, and the inclusion of more women in projects. Advocating for equality and inclusion is an extension of my perspective shaped through my life experiences.
