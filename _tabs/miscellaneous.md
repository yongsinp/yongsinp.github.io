**For de-stressing I do**: Laundry. There is something soothing about taking care of your fabrics. If there is nothing to launder, I go to the gym, go out for a jog, or if it's too cold outside, meditate.

**For killing time I do**: ...Laundry. But if there is nothing to wash, I read books, watch movies, or listen to music.

**Hobbies**: I like to take ðŸ“¸, promote the use of sunscreen, or go searching for a new [cologne](https://yongsinp.notion.site/fc39360585af4ac0b59061f6f169c117?v=82dd40dff5fd48ce863fb2c5e843c844&pvs=4).

I am a member of the organizing committee of Seoul Queer Culture Festival (Seoul Pride) and Korea Queer Film Festival. Some of the movies I translated and revised:
 - [i get so sad sometimes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18816128/) (Trishtan Perez)
 - [The Note](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21480270/) (Jen Nee Lim)
 - [Reflections](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26879938/) (Kane Lee Kwik)
